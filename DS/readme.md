# Usage of code in Question 3

## Assumptions

The input is given as follows:

    1. N (number of vertices)
    2. E [v1] [v1] [w] (Edge between v1 and v2 with weight w)

Also, I have made the assumption that the given input is for an undirected graph.

## List of Functionality Input

* N [v] / n [v]

    Prints all the neighbors of the input vertex v.

* W [v1] [v2] / w [v1] [v2]

    Prints the weight of the edge between v1 and v2. Prints -1 if no edge exists.

* C [v1] [v2] / c [v1] [v2]

    Prints 1 if an edge exists between v1 and v2. Prints 0 otherwise.

* V [v] / v [v]

    Prints 1 if v is a vertex in the given graph.

* A / a

    Prints all the vertices in the given graph.
